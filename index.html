a little man does.  If I could have gone in that day I'd a told him... Junk 'em Steve, we can afford it.  But
alone he was afraid.  But I know he meant no harm.  He believed they'd hold up a hundred percent.  
That's a mistake, but it ain't murder.  You mustn't feel that way about him.</p></div>
<p>Joe: Kid, walkin' down the street that day I was guilty as hell. Except I wasn't, and there was a court paper in my pocket to prove I wasn't, I and I walked… past… the porches. Result? Fourteen months later I had one of the best shops in the state again, a respected man again; bigger than ever.</p>
